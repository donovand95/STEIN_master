After opening up the mybinder link, the primary script is called master_script_STEIN.ipynb. Open that one.

Use ctrl + enter to run each block of code. If there is an error message, you have to be sure to re-run all the prior blocks of code, as these interactively set the values for the different parameters.

Sometimes the Helium scripts take a while to run... like hours.

Viel Spass--DPD
